about: Request a new artifact be added to the public repository

We happily accept any public images into our artifact repository for public access. The repository is CDN fronted for fast world-wide access. In order to add a new artifact, simply complete the template below:

Path to the wiki page (existing or not) where this artifact will be initially linked:
/wiki/

Source(s) of the existing artifact (supported links are ftp, http, https, and the following services are also supported: Google Drive, MEGA, Baidu Cloud, OneDrive):
https://

Any known checksums of the existing artifact(s):

If the existing artifact needs a login to get around bandwidth limits, etc. please adjust the following line so that you can be contacted for that information:
This link does NOT require a login to access

It does not matter if the filename matches another in the repository, or if this is a new version of a file with the same URL (like a "latest" download). Each URL that is stored in the repository has a unique identifier attached to avoid conflicts. Once the URL(s) are added to the artifact repository, this image will be closed with links for each of the URLs stored and their new artifact URLs for use in the wiki. It's up to the user who opened the request to add the links to the wiki.

There is no need to open a request to remove an an artifact when a page is removed or the old version is no longer used. We want to keep an archive of these for a multitude of reasons.

Thanks for contributing to the wiki!
